# Naive Bayes Algorithm

# Introduction
Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It is commonly used for classification tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis. The algorithm assumes that features are conditionally independent, making it efficient for large datasets.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data before training the model.
2. Model Training: Implementing Naïve Bayes Classifier using scikit-learn.
3. Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

# Installation and Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azkalltlhn/NaiveBayes-Algorithm.git

2. **Install the required dependencies::**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Run the notebook:
- Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Load the file NaiveBayesAlgorithm_Azka_Lailatul_Hana.ipynb.
- Run all cells.

# Results and Evaluation
The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.
